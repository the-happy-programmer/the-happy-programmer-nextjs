Color Gradient has become very common lately. It has been applied to logos and it looks extremely eye candy. In this post, you will be shown how to apply it in LinearGradient in SwiftUI for both Light and Dark theme

## Add Asset color

The first step we need to take is to make two Asset colors. Borth for light and dark theme, we could have used the `colorScheme` to detect whether is `.light` or `.dark` theme and by using if statements to make the system respond accordingly. This time we will achieve the same result in a neater way, by adding Asset colours, that way we will avoid many lines of code.

By going to assets we can add the wanted colors, feel free to choose your own combination. I will be choosing Dark Green and Teal because they blend together beautifully.

Add Colors on Assets file

Try to pick light colours for the light theme and dark for the dark theme. SwifUI allows us to set colors which will change according to the theme we are currently in.

Add a Color, you will find at the bottom

This is my suggested combination

The bellow combination is a purple in light mode and a teal in dark mode. As you can see, Xcode gives your the opportunity to choose 8-bit RGB. The choice is yours. The LinearGradient will work with any color combination, but bear in mind it has to fulfil aesthetics requirements.

This is the dark mode teal color.

Do the same with another combination of colors.

This is my Color1

The orange

The Green

## Create data to iterate

in order to avoid repeating the same code, I decided to create mock data.

```swift
struct Card: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let name: String
    let photo: String
    let title: String
    let subTitle: String
}
let cards = [
    Card(name: "Nicky Dolores", photo: "user", title: "Make up Artist", subTitle: "Hourly - 24$"),
    Card(name: "Elie Smith", photo: "user1", title: "Model", subTitle: "Hourly - 400$"),
    Card(name: "Debby Doe", photo: "user2", title: "Influencer", subTitle: "Hourly - 2,004$")
]
```

## Usage of LinearGradient

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            ScrollView(showsIndicators: false) {
                ForEach(cards) { c in
                    VStack(alignment: .trailing ) {
                        HStack(alignment: .top){
                            VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                                Text(c.title)
                                    .font(.title)
                                    .bold()
                                Text(c.subTitle)
                                    .font(.subheadline)
                                    .foregroundColor(Color.secondary)
                            }.padding(.horizontal, 0)
                            Spacer()
                        }.padding()
                        Spacer()
                        HStack {
                            HStack {
                                Text(c.name)
                                    .font(.caption)
                                    .fontWeight(.black)
                                    .foregroundColor(Color.secondary)

                                    Spacer()
                                Image(c.photo)
                                    .resizable()
                                    .frame(width: 40, height: 40, alignment: .center)
                                    .clipShape(Circle())
                                    .shadow(radius: 5)
                            }.padding()

                        }.background(Color.black.opacity(0.2))
                    }

                    .frame(width: 370, height: 280)
                    .background(LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [Color("Color1"), Color("Color2")]), startPoint: .top, endPoint: .bottomTrailing))
                    .cornerRadius(20)
                    .shadow(radius: 12)
                    .padding(.bottom, 20)
                }
                .padding(35)
            } .padding(-20)
            .navigationTitle("Professionals")
        }
    }
}
```

There are a lot of things to explain, but I will focus on the lesson for this post.

```swift
.background(LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [Color("Color1"), Color("Color2")]), startPoint: .top, endPoint: .bottomTrailing))
```

The colors we created are `Color("Color1")` and `Color("Color2")`. Which they have representatives in both light and dark appearance.

The `startPoint: .top`, is the starting point for the color and there are many options which represent when the first color will start. Same with `endPoint: .bottomTrailing` which is where it will start the transition of the color.
