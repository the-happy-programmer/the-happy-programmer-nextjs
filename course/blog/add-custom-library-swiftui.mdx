SwiftUI 2.0 has allowed us to be able to add our own custom items in the library.In this post I will cover how to add custom Library Items in SwiftUI. I will also cover modifiers for `Images` where you can use the same logic to make modifiers for any View.

_**If you want to make your own Library on SwiftUI 2, so can you reuse it every time you need.**_

We will create an extension as well as a code snippet, which means. We can add in the View Library both views and styles.

Why do this?

- Not repeating yourself as a programmer is crucial.
- The code will look clean and neat.
- your code is accessible and organised

when we are done you will see you own Control in Library

## Image Extension

we can create any control we want, in this particular example I will be making a reusable image style, which it will give a particular shape to any image we want, and we can give decide the height and the width.

```swift
extension Image {
    func imgAvatar(width: CGFloat, height: CGFloat) -> some View {
        self
            .resizable()
            .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
            .frame(width: width, height: width)
            .clipShape(Circle())

    }
}
```

The above code will create a control where you can apply to any Image Views and give a specified width and height.

## How to add a modifier in the Library

```swift
struct LibraryContent: LibraryContentProvider {
    @LibraryContentBuilder
    func modifiers(base: Image) -> [LibraryItem] {
        LibraryItem(
            base.imgAvatar(width: 50, height: 50),
            title: "Avatar Circular Image",
            category: .control
        )
    }
}
```

Note, `category: .control` represents the category of the library item

Now we can see the item we created in the library

## Add a View in the Library

Let's make a View by using the extension we created and add that in the library too.

```swift
struct ViewLibrary: LibraryContentProvider {
    @LibraryContentBuilder
    var views: [LibraryItem] {
        LibraryItem(
            ChatRow(photo: "user1", name: "James", message: "Hello", time: "20:20"),
            title: "Chat Row",
            category: .control
        )
    }
}
```

As you can see, you this time is we are making a View and not a modifier.

```swift
struct ChatRow: View {

    var photo: String
    var name: String
    var message: String
    var time: String

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            HStack {
                Image(photo).imgAvatar(width: 50, height: 50)
                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    Text(name)
                        .font(.headline)
                    Text(message)
                        .font(.subheadline)
                        .foregroundColor(Color.gray)
                        .lineLimit(1)
                }
                Spacer()
                Text(time)
                    .font(.caption)
                    .foregroundColor(Color.gray)

            }
        }.padding(.horizontal, 10)
    }
}
```

By using the modifier we already created `.imgAvatar(width: 50, height: 50)`. We made a view, and we added this view in our library.

Let's use the above library items to make a clean looking code base for a messaging list. That was it can be seen how only by adding two items in our library we can create a very simple looking view.

First, we need the data

```swift
struct Messages: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let name: String
    let photo: String
    let message: String
    let time: String
}
let messages = [
    Messages( name: "James" , photo: "user1" , message: "Hey there 🤚🏻", time: "12:30"),
    Messages( name: "Mark" , photo: "user2" , message: "Hello, do you mind to pick up a coffe for me?", time: "12:24"),
    Messages( name: "Jim" , photo: "user3" , message: "Hey ", time: "10:30"),
    Messages( name: "Joe" , photo: "user4" , message: "You alright? 🤚", time: "9:30"),
    Messages( name: "Tony" , photo: "user5" , message: "Are you there? 🤔", time: "5:30"),
    Messages( name: "Jasmin" , photo: "user6" , message: "hmmm ", time: "22:10"),
    Messages( name: "Elise" , photo: "user7" , message: "ok 👍🏻", time: "22:00"),
    Messages( name: "Angela" , photo: "user8" , message: "hahaha 🤭", time: "21:50"),
    Messages( name: "James" , photo: "user9" , message: "Goodnight 🥱", time: "21:20"),
    Messages( name: "James" , photo: "user10" , message: "I got my first donate 🤑", time: "20:40"),
]
```

## Combine Everything Together

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(messages) { user in
                ChatRow(photo: user.photo,name: user.name,message: user.message, time: user.time)

            }.listStyle(PlainListStyle())
            .navigationBarTitle("Messages")
            .navigationBarItems(leading:EditButton(), trailing: Image("user").imgAvatar(width: 30, height: 30))


        }
    }
}
```

## Result
